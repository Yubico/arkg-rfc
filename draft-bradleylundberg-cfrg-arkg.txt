        The Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (ARKG) algorithm
                 draft-bradleylundberg-cfrg-arkg-latest

Abstract

   Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (ARKG) is an abstract algorithm
   that enables delegation of asymmetric public key generation without
   giving access to the corresponding private keys.  This capability
   enables a variety of applications: a user agent can generate
   pseudonymous public keys to prevent tracking; a message sender can
   generate ephemeral recipient public keys to enhance forward secrecy;
   two paired authentication devices can each have their own private
   keys while each can register public keys on behalf of the other.

   This document provides three main contributions: a specification of
   the generic ARKG algorithm using abstract primitives; a set of
   formulae for instantiating the abstract primitives using concrete
   primitives; and an initial set of fully specified concrete ARKG
   instances.  We expect that additional instances will be defined in
   the future.

1.  Introduction

   Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (ARKG) introduces a mechanism to
   generate public keys without access to the corresponding private
   keys.  Such a mechanism is useful for many scenarios when a new
   public key is needed but the private key holder is not available to
   perform the key generation.  This may occur when private keys are
   stored in a hardware security device, which may be unavailable or
   locked at the time a new public key is needed.

   Some motivating use cases of ARKG include:

   *  *Single-use asymmetric keys*: Envisioned for the European Union's
      digital identity framework, which is set to use single-use
      asymmetric keys to prevent colluding verifiers from using public
      keys as correlation handles.  Each digital identity credential
      would thus be issued with a single-use proof-of-possession key,
      used only once to present the credential to a verifier.  ARKG
      empowers both online and offline usage scenarios: for offline
      scenarios, ARKG enables pre-generation of public keys for single-
      use credentials without needing to access the hardware security
      device that holds the private keys.  For online scenarios, ARKG
      gives the credential issuer assurance that all derived private
      keys are bound to the same secure hardware element.  In both
      cases, application performance may be improved since public keys
      can be generated in a general-purpose execution environment
      instead of a secure enclave.

   *  *Enhanced forward secrecy*: The use of ARKG can facilitate forward
      secrecy in certain contexts.  For instance, section 8.5.4 of RFC
      9052 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9052.html#name-direct-key-
      agreement) notes that "Since COSE is designed for a store-and-
      forward environment rather than an online environment, [...]
      forward secrecy (see [RFC4949]) is not achievable.  A static key
      will always be used for the receiver of the COSE object."  As
      opposed to workarounds like exchanging a large number of keys in
      advance, ARKG enables the the sender to generate ephemeral
      recipient public keys on demand.

   *  *Backup key generation*: For example, the W3C Web Authentication
      API [WebAuthn] (WebAuthn) generates a new key pair for each
      account on each web site.  ARKG could allow for simultaneously
      generating a backup public key when registering a new public key.
      A primary authenticator could generate both a key pair for itself
      and a public key for a paired backup authenticator.  The backup
      authenticator only needs to be paired with the primary
      authenticator once, and can then be safely stored until it is
      needed.

   ARKG consists of three procedures:

   *  *Initialization*: The _delegating party_ generates a _seed pair_
      and discloses the _public seed_ to a _subordinate party_, while
      securely retaining the _private seed_.

   *  *Public key generation*: The subordinate party uses the public
      seed to autonomously generate a new public key along with a unique
      _key handle_ for the public key.  This can be repeated any number
      of times.

   *  *Private key derivation*: The delegating party uses a key handle
      and the private seed to derive the private key corresponding to
      the public key generated along with the key handle.  This can be
      repeated with any number of key handles.

   Notably, ARKG can be built entirely using established cryptographic
   primitives.  The required primitives are a public key blinding scheme
   and a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), which may in turn use a key
   derivation function (KDF) and a message authentication code (MAC)
   scheme.  Both conventional primitives and quantum-resistant
   alternatives exist that meet these requirements.  [Wilson]

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Notation

   The following notation is used throughout this document:

   *  The symbol || represents octet string concatenation.

   *  Literal text strings and octet strings are denoted using the CDDL
      syntax defined in Section 3.1 of [RFC8610].

   *  Elliptic curve operations are written in additive notation: +
      denotes point addition, i.e., the curve group operation; * denotes
      point multiplication, i.e., repeated point addition; and + also
      denotes scalar addition modulo the curve order. * has higher
      precedence than +, i.e., a + b * C is equivalent to a + (b * C).

   *  LEN(x) is the length, in octets, of the octet string x.

   *  The function I2OSP converts a nonnegative integer into an octet
      string as defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC8017].

2.  The Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (ARKG) algorithm

   The ARKG algorithm consists of three functions, each performed by one
   of two participants: the _delegating party_ or the _subordinate
   party_. The delegating party generates an ARKG _seed pair_ and emits
   the _public seed_ to the subordinate party while keeping the _private
   seed_ secret.  The subordinate party can then use the public seed to
   generate derived public keys and _key handles_, and the delegating
   party can use the private seed and a key handle to derive the
   corresponding private key.

   This construction of ARKG is fully deterministic, extracting input
   entropy as explicit parameters, as opposed to the internal random
   sampling typically used in the academic literature [Frymann2020]
   [Wilson] [Clermont].  Implementations MAY choose to instead implement
   the ARKG-Derive-Seed and KEM-Encaps functions as nondeterministic
   procedures omitting their respective ikm parameters and sampling
   random entropy internally; this choice does not affect
   interoperability.

   The following subsections define the abstract instance parameters
   used to construct the three ARKG functions, followed by the
   definitions of the three ARKG functions.

2.1.  Instance parameters

   ARKG is composed of a suite of other algorithms.  The parameters of
   an ARKG instance are:

   *  BL: An asymmetric key blinding scheme [Wilson], consisting of:

      -  Function BL-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm) -> (pk, sk): Derive a blinding
         key pair.

         Input consists of input keying material entropy ikm.

         Output consists of a blinding public key pk and a blinding
         private key sk.

      -  Function BL-PRF(ikm_tau, ctx) -> tau: Derive a pseudorandom
         blinding factor.

         Input consists of input entropy ikm_tau and a domain separation
         parameter ctx.

         Output consists of the blinding factor tau.

      -  Function BL-Blind-Public-Key(pk, tau) -> pk_tau:
         Deterministically compute a blinded public key.

         Input consists of a blinding public key pk, and a blinding
         factor tau.

         Output consists of the blinded public key pk_tau.

      -  Function BL-Blind-Private-Key(sk, tau) -> sk_tau:
         Deterministically compute a blinded private key.

         Input consists of a blinding private key sk, and the blinding
         factor tau.

         Output consists of the blinded private key sk_tau.

      ikm is an opaque octet string of a suitable length as defined by
      the ARKG instance. ikm_tau is an opaque octet string generated as
      the k output of KEM-Encaps and KEM-Decaps. ctx is an opaque octet
      string of arbitrary length.

      The representations of pk and pk_tau are defined by the protocol
      that invokes ARKG.  The representations of sk, tau and sk_tau are
      undefined implementation details.

      See [Wilson] for definitions of security properties required of
      the key blinding scheme BL.

   *  KEM: A key encapsulation mechanism [Shoup], consisting of the
      functions:

      -  KEM-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm) -> (pk, sk): Derive a key
         encapsulation key pair.

         Input consists of input keying material entropy ikm.

         Output consists of public key pk and private key sk.

      -  KEM-Encaps(pk, ikm, ctx) -> (k, c): Derive a key encapsulation.

         Input consists of an encapsulation public key pk, input entropy
         ikm and a domain separation parameter ctx.

         Output consists of a shared secret k and an encapsulation
         ciphertext c.

      -  KEM-Decaps(sk, c, ctx) -> k: Decapsulate a shared secret.

         Input consists of encapsulation private key sk, encapsulation
         ciphertext c and a domain separation parameter ctx.

         Output consists of the shared secret k on success, or an error
         otherwise.

      ikm is an opaque octet string of a suitable length as defined by
      the ARKG instance. k, c and ctx are opaque octet strings of
      arbitrary length.  The representation of pk is defined by the
      protocol that invokes ARKG.  The representation of sk is an
      undefined implementation detail.

      The KEM MUST guarantee integrity of the ciphertext, meaning that
      knowledge of the public key pk and the domain separation parameter
      ctx is required in order to create any ciphertext c that can be
      successfully decapsulated by the corresponding private key sk.
      Section 3.2 describes a general formula for how any KEM can be
      adapted to include this guarantee.  Section 9.1 discusses the
      reasons for this requirement.

      See [Wilson] for definitions of additional security properties
      required of the key encapsulation mechanism KEM.

   A concrete ARKG instantiation MUST specify the instantiation of each
   of the above functions.

   The output keys of the BL scheme are also the output keys of the ARKG
   instance as a whole.  For example, if BL-Blind-Public-Key and BL-
   Blind-Private-Key output ECDSA keys, then the ARKG instance will also
   output ECDSA keys.

   We denote a concrete ARKG instance by the pattern ARKG-NAME,
   substituting for NAME some description of the chosen instantiation
   for BL and KEM.  Note that this pattern cannot in general be
   unambiguously parsed; implementations MUST NOT attempt to construct
   an ARKG instance by parsing such a pattern string.  Concrete ARKG
   instances MUST always be identified by lookup in a registry of fully
   specified ARKG instances.  This is to prevent usage of algorithm
   combinations that may be incompatible or insecure.

2.2.  The function ARKG-Derive-Seed

   This function is performed by the delegating party.  The delegating
   party derives the ARKG seed pair (pk, sk) and keeps the private seed
   sk secret, while the public seed pk is provided to the subordinate
   party.  The subordinate party will then be able to derive public keys
   on behalf of the delegating party.

   ARKG-Derive-Seed(ikm_bl, ikm_kem) -> (pk, sk)
       ARKG instance parameters:
           BL        A key blinding scheme.
           KEM       A key encapsulation mechanism.

       Inputs:
           ikm_bl    Input keying material entropy for BL.
           ikm_kem   Input keying material entropy for KEM.

       Output:
           (pk, sk)  An ARKG seed pair with public seed pk
                       and private seed sk.

       The output (pk, sk) is calculated as follows:

       (pk_bl,  sk_bl)  = BL-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm_bl)
       (pk_kem, sk_kem) = KEM-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm_kem)
       pk = (pk_bl, pk_kem)
       sk = (sk_bl, sk_kem)

2.2.1.  Nondeterministic variants

   Applications that do not need a deterministic interface MAY choose to
   instead implement ARKG-Derive-Seed, KEM-Derive-Key-Pair and BL-
   Derive-Key-Pair as nondeterministic procedures omitting their
   respective ikm parameters and sampling random entropy internally;
   this choice does not affect interoperability.

2.3.  The function ARKG-Derive-Public-Key

   This function is performed by the subordinate party, which holds the
   ARKG public seed pk = (pk_bl, pk_kem).  The resulting public key pk'
   can be provided to external parties to use in asymmetric cryptography
   protocols, and the resulting key handle kh can be used by the
   delegating party to derive the private key corresponding to pk'.

   This function may be invoked any number of times with the same public
   seed, using different ikm or ctx arguments, in order to generate any
   number of public keys.

   ARKG-Derive-Public-Key((pk_bl, pk_kem), ikm, ctx) -> (pk', kh)
       ARKG instance parameters:
           BL        A key blinding scheme.
           KEM       A key encapsulation mechanism.

       Inputs:
           pk_bl     A key blinding public key.
           pk_kem    A key encapsulation public key.
           ikm       Input entropy for KEM encapsulation.
           ctx       An octet string of length at most 64,
                       containing optional context and
                       application specific information
                       (can be a zero-length string).

       Output:
           pk'       A blinded public key.
           kh        A key handle for deriving the blinded
                       private key sk' corresponding to pk'.

       The output (pk', kh) is calculated as follows:

       if LEN(ctx) > 64:
           Abort with an error.

       ctx'    = I2OSP(LEN(ctx), 1) || ctx
       ctx_bl  = 'ARKG-Derive-Key-BL.'  || ctx'
       ctx_kem = 'ARKG-Derive-Key-KEM.' || ctx'

       (ikm_tau, c) = KEM-Encaps(pk_kem, ikm, ctx_kem)
       tau = BL-PRF(ikm_tau, ctx_bl)
       pk' = BL-Blind-Public-Key(pk_bl, tau)

       kh = c

   If this procedure aborts due to an error, the procedure can safely be
   retried with the same (pk_bl, pk_kem) and ctx arguments but a new ikm
   argument.

   See Section 2.5 for guidance on using ctx arguments longer than 64
   bytes.

2.3.1.  Nondeterministic variants

   Applications that do not need a deterministic interface MAY choose to
   instead implement ARKG-Derive-Public-Key and KEM-Encaps as
   nondeterministic procedures omitting their respective ikm parameter
   and sampling random entropy internally; this choice does not affect
   interoperability.

   BL-PRF and BL-Blind-Public-Key must always be deterministic for
   compatibility with ARKG-Derive-Private-Key.

2.4.  The function ARKG-Derive-Private-Key

   This function is performed by the delegating party, which holds the
   ARKG private seed (sk_bl, sk_kem).  The resulting private key sk' can
   be used in asymmetric cryptography protocols to prove possession of
   sk' to an external party that has the corresponding public key.

   This function may be invoked any number of times with the same
   private seed, in order to derive the same or different private keys
   any number of times.

   ARKG-Derive-Private-Key((sk_bl, sk_kem), kh, ctx) -> sk'
       ARKG instance parameters:
           BL        A key blinding scheme.
           KEM       A key encapsulation mechanism.

       Inputs:
           sk_bl     A key blinding private key.
           sk_kem    A key encapsulation private key.
           kh        A key handle output from ARKG-Derive-Public-Key.
           ctx       An octet string of length at most 64,
                       containing optional context and
                       application specific information
                       (can be a zero-length string).

       Output:
           sk'       A blinded private key.

       The output sk' is calculated as follows:

       if LEN(ctx) > 64:
           Abort with an error.

       ctx'    = I2OSP(LEN(ctx), 1) || ctx
       ctx_bl  = 'ARKG-Derive-Key-BL.'  || ctx'
       ctx_kem = 'ARKG-Derive-Key-KEM.' || ctx'

       ikm_tau = KEM-Decaps(sk_kem, kh, ctx_kem)
       If decapsulation failed:
           Abort with an error.

       tau = BL-PRF(ikm_tau, ctx_bl)
       sk' = BL-Blind-Private-Key(sk_bl, tau)

   Errors in this procedure are typically unrecoverable.  For example,
   KEM-Decaps may fail to decapsulate the KEM ciphertext kh if it fails
   an integrity check.  ARKG instantiations SHOULD be chosen in a way
   that such errors are impossible if kh was generated by an honest and
   correct implementation of ARKG-Derive-Public-Key. Incorrect or
   malicious implementations of ARKG-Derive-Public-Key do not degrade
   the security of an honest and correct implementation of ARKG-Derive-
   Private-Key. See also Section 9.1.

   See Section 2.5 for guidance on using ctx arguments longer than 64
   bytes.

2.5.  Using ctx values longer than 64 bytes

   The ctx parameter of ARKG-Derive-Public-Key and ARKG-Derive-Private-
   Key is limited to a length of at most 64 bytes.  This is because this
   value needs to be communicated from the _subordinate party_ to the
   _delegating party_ to use the same argument value in both functions,
   therefore it is necessary in some contexts to limit the size of this
   parameter in order to limit the size of overall protocol messages.

   If applications require ctx values longer than 64 bytes, implementors
   MAY use techniques such as that described in Section 5.3.3 of
   [RFC9380].  Precise procedure definitions are left as an application-
   specific implementation detail.

3.  Generic ARKG instantiations

   This section defines generic formulae for instantiating the
   individual ARKG parameters, which can be used to define concrete ARKG
   instantiations.

3.1.  Using elliptic curve addition for key blinding

   Instantiations of ARKG whose output keys are elliptic curve keys can
   use elliptic curve addition as the key blinding scheme BL
   [Frymann2020] [Wilson].  This section defines a general formula for
   such instantiations of BL.

   This formula has the following parameters:

   *  crv: An elliptic curve.

   *  hash-to-crv-suite: A hash-to-curve suite [RFC9380] suitable for
      hashing to the scalar field of crv.

   *  DST_ext: A domain separation tag.

   Then the BL parameter of ARKG may be instantiated as follows:

   *  G is the generator of the prime order subgroup of crv.

   *  N is the order of G.

   *  The function hash_to_field is defined in Section 5 of [RFC9380].

   BL-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm) -> (pk, sk)

       DST_bl_sk = 'ARKG-BL-EC-KG.' || DST_ext
       sk = hash_to_field(ikm, 1) with the parameters:
           DST: DST_bl_sk
           F: GF(N), the scalar field
              of the prime order subgroup of crv
           p: N
           m: 1
           L: The L defined in hash-to-crv-suite
           expand_message: The expand_message function
                           defined in hash-to-crv-suite

       pk = sk * G


   BL-PRF(ikm_tau, ctx) -> tau

       DST_tau = 'ARKG-BL-EC.' || DST_ext || ctx
       tau = hash_to_field(ikm_tau, 1) with the parameters:
           DST: DST_tau
           F: GF(N), the scalar field
              of the prime order subgroup of crv
           p: N
           m: 1
           L: The L defined in hash-to-crv-suite
           expand_message: The expand_message function
                           defined in hash-to-crv-suite


   BL-Blind-Public-Key(pk, tau) -> pk_tau

       pk_tau = pk + tau * G


   BL-Blind-Private-Key(sk, tau) -> sk_tau

       sk_tau_tmp = sk + tau'
       If sk_tau_tmp = 0, abort with an error.
       sk_tau = sk_tau_tmp

3.2.  Using HMAC to adapt a KEM without ciphertext integrity

   Not all key encapsulation mechanisms guarantee ciphertext integrity,
   meaning that a valid KEM ciphertext can be created only with
   knowledge of the KEM public key.  This section defines a general
   formula for adapting any KEM to guarantee ciphertext integrity by
   prepending a MAC to the KEM ciphertext.

   For example, ECDH does not guarantee ciphertext integrity - any
   elliptic curve point is a valid ECDH ciphertext and can be
   successfully decapsulated using any elliptic curve private scalar.

   This formula has the following parameters:

   *  Hash: A cryptographic hash function.

   *  DST_ext: A domain separation parameter.

   *  Sub-Kem: A key encapsulation mechanism as described for the KEM
      parameter in Section 2.1, except Sub-Kem MAY ignore the ctx
      parameter and MAY not guarantee ciphertext integrity.  Sub-Kem
      defines the functions Sub-Kem-Derive-Key-Pair, Sub-Kem-Encaps and
      Sub-Kem-Decaps.

   The KEM parameter of ARKG may be instantiated using Sub-Kem, HMAC
   [RFC2104] and HKDF [RFC5869] as follows:

   *  L is the output length of Hash in octets.

   *  LEFT(X, n) is the first n bytes of the byte array X.

   *  DROP_LEFT(X, n) is the byte array X without the first n bytes.

   We truncate the HMAC output to 128 bits (16 octets) because as
   described in Section 9.1, ARKG needs ciphertext integrity only to
   ensure correctness, not for security.  Extendable-output functions
   used as the Hash parameter SHOULD still be instantiated with an
   output length appropriate for the desired security level, in order to
   not leak information about the Sub-Kem shared secret key.

   KEM-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm) -> (pk, sk)

       (pk, sk) = Sub-Kem-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm)


   KEM-Encaps(pk, ikm, ctx) -> (k, c)

       ctx_sub = 'ARKG-KEM-HMAC.' || DST_ext || ctx
       (k', c') = Sub-Kem-Encaps(pk, ikm, ctx_sub)

       prk = HKDF-Extract with the arguments:
           Hash: Hash
           salt: not set
           IKM: k'

       info_mk = 'ARKG-KEM-HMAC-mac.' || DST_ext || ctx
       mk = HKDF-Expand with the arguments:
           Hash: Hash
           PRK: prk
           info: info_mk
           L: L
       t = HMAC-Hash-128(K=mk, text=c')

       info_k = 'ARKG-KEM-HMAC-shared.' || DST_ext || ctx
       k = HKDF-Expand with the arguments:
           Hash: Hash
           PRK: prk
           info: info_k
           L: The length of k' in octets.
       c = t || c'


   KEM-Decaps(sk, c, ctx) -> k

       t = LEFT(c, 16)
       c' = DROP_LEFT(c, 16)
       ctx_sub = 'ARKG-KEM-HMAC.' || DST_ext || ctx
       k' = Sub-Kem-Decaps(sk, c', ctx_sub)

       prk = HKDF-Extract with the arguments:
           Hash: Hash
           salt: not set
           IKM: k'

       mk = HKDF-Expand with the arguments:
           Hash: Hash
           PRK: prk
           info: 'ARKG-KEM-HMAC-mac.' || DST_ext || ctx
           L: L

       t' = HMAC-Hash-128(K=mk, text=c')
       If t = t':
           k = HKDF-Expand with the arguments:
               Hash: Hash
               PRK: prk
               info: 'ARKG-KEM-HMAC-shared.' || DST_ext || ctx
               L: The length of k' in octets.
       Else:
           Abort with an error.

   In concrete instances where Sub-Kem-Encaps and Sub-Kem-Decaps ignore
   the ctx parameter, implementations MAY eliminate the parameter and
   omit the computation of ctx_sub.

3.3.  Using ECDH as the KEM

   Instantiations of ARKG can use ECDH [RFC6090] as the key
   encapsulation mechanism KEM [Frymann2020] [Wilson].  This section
   defines a general formula for such instantiations of KEM.

   This formula has the following parameters:

   *  crv: an elliptic curve valid for use with ECDH [RFC6090].

   *  Hash: A cryptographic hash function.

   *  hash-to-crv-suite: A hash-to-curve suite [RFC9380] suitable for
      hashing to the scalar field of crv.

   *  DST_ext: A domain separation parameter.

   The above parameters define the following intermediate value:

   *  DST_aug: 'ARKG-ECDH.' || DST_ext.

   The KEM parameter of ARKG may be instantiated as described in section
   Section 3.2 with the parameters:

   *  Hash: Hash.

   *  DST_ext: DST_aug.

   *  Sub-Kem: The functions Sub-Kem-Derive-Key-Pair, Sub-Kem-Encaps and
      Sub-Kem-Decaps defined as follows:

      -  Elliptic-Curve-Point-to-Octet-String and Octet-String-to-
         Elliptic-Curve-Point are the conversion routines defined in
         sections 2.3.3 and 2.3.4 of [SEC1], without point compression.

      -  ECDH(pk, sk) represents the compact output of ECDH [RFC6090]
         using public key (curve point) pk and private key (exponent)
         sk.

      -  G is the generator of the prime order subgroup of crv.

      -  N is the order of G.

      Sub-Kem-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm) -> (pk, sk)

          DST_kem_sk = 'ARKG-KEM-ECDH-KG.' || DST_aug
          sk = hash_to_field(ikm, 1) with the parameters:
              DST: DST_kem_sk
              F: GF(N), the scalar field
                of the prime order subgroup of crv
              p: N
              m: 1
              L: The L defined in hash-to-crv-suite
              expand_message: The expand_message function
                              defined in hash-to-crv-suite

          pk = sk * G


      Sub-Kem-Encaps(pk, ikm, ctx) -> (k, c)

          (pk', sk') = Sub-Kem-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm)

          k = ECDH(pk, sk')
          c = Elliptic-Curve-Point-to-Octet-String(pk')


      Sub-Kem-Decaps(sk, c, ctx) -> k

          pk' = Octet-String-to-Elliptic-Curve-Point(c)
          k = ECDH(pk', sk)

   Note: This instance intentionally ignores the ctx parameter of Sub-
   Kem-Encaps and Sub-Kem-Decaps.

3.4.  Using X25519 or X448 as the KEM

   Instantiations of ARKG can use X25519 or X448 [RFC7748] as the key
   encapsulation mechanism KEM.  This section defines a general formula
   for such instantiations of KEM.

   This formula has the following parameters:

   *  DH-Function: the function X25519 or the function X448 [RFC7748].

   *  DST_ext: A domain separation parameter.

   The KEM parameter of ARKG may be instantiated as described in section
   Section 3.2 with the parameters:

   *  Hash: SHA-512 [FIPS 180-4] if DH-Function is X25519, or SHAKE256
      [FIPS 202] with output length 64 octets if DH-Function is X448.

   *  DST_ext: 'ARKG-ECDHX.' || DST_ext.

   *  Sub-Kem: The functions Sub-Kem-Derive-Key-Pair, Sub-Kem-Encaps and
      Sub-Kem-Decaps defined as follows:

      -  G is the octet string h'0900000000000000 0000000000000000
         0000000000000000 0000000000000000' if DH-Function is X25519, or
         the octet string h'0500000000000000 0000000000000000
         0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000000
         0000000000000000 0000000000000000' if DH-Function is X448.

         These are the little-endian encodings of the integers 9 and 5,
         which is the u-coordinate of the generator point of the
         respective curve group.

      Sub-Kem-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm) -> (pk, sk)

          sk = ikm
          pk = DH-Function(sk, G)


      Sub-Kem-Encaps(pk, ikm, ctx) -> (k, c)

          (pk', sk') = Sub-Kem-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm)

          k = DH-Function(sk', pk)
          c = pk'


      Sub-Kem-Decaps(sk, c, ctx) -> k

          k = DH-Function(sk, c)

   Note: This instance intentionally ignores the ctx parameter of Sub-
   Kem-Encaps and Sub-Kem-Decaps.

3.5.  Using the same key for both key blinding and KEM

   When an ARKG instance uses the same type of key for both the key
   blinding and the KEM - for example, if elliptic curve arithmetic is
   used for key blinding as described in Section 3.1 and ECDH is used as
   the KEM as described in Section 3.3 [Frymann2020] - then the two keys
   MAY be the same key.  Representations of such an ARKG seed MAY allow
   for omitting the second copy of the constituent key, but such
   representations MUST clearly identify that the single constituent key
   is to be used both as the key blinding key and the KEM key.

5.  COSE bindings

   This section proposes additions to COSE [RFC9052] to support ARKG use
   cases.  These consist of new key type definitions to represent ARKG
   public seeds and references [I-D.lundberg-cose-2p-algs] to private
   keys derived using ARKG.

5.1.  COSE key type: ARKG public seed

   An ARKG public seed is represented as a COSE_Key structure [RFC9052]
   with kty value TBD (placeholder value -65537).  Table 1 defines key
   type parameters pkbl (-1) and pkkem (-2) for the BL and KEM public
   key, respectively, as well as key type parameter dkalg (-3),
   representing the algorithm that derived public and private keys are
   to be used with.

   +-------+-------+----------+-----------+----------------------------+

        Table 1: COSE key type parameters for the ARKG-pub key type.

   When dkalg (-3) is present in an ARKG public seed, the alg (3)
   parameter of public keys derived using ARKG-Derive-Public-Key with
   that seed SHOULD be set to the dkalg (-3) value of the seed.

   The alg (3) parameter, when present, identifies the ARKG instance
   this public seed is to be used with.  Table 2 defines an initial set
   of COSE algorithm identifiers for this purpose.

     Table 2: COSE algorithm identifiers to represent ARKG instances.

   The following CDDL [RFC8610] example represents an ARKG-P256 public
   seed restricted to generating derived keys for use with the ESP256
   [I-D.jose-fully-spec-algs] signature algorithm:

   {
     1: -65537,   ; kty: ARKG-pub (placeholder value)
                  ; kid: Opaque identifier
     2: h'60b6dfddd31659598ae5de49acb220d8
          704949e84d484b68344340e2565337d2',
     3: -65700,   ; alg: ARKG-P256 (placeholder value)

     -1: {        ; BL public key
       1: 2,      ; kty: EC2
       -1: 1,     ; crv: P256
       -2: h'69380FC1C3B09652134FEEFBA61776F9
             7AF875CE46CA20252C4165102966EBC5',
       -3: h'8B515831462CCB0BD55CBA04BFD50DA6
             3FAF18BD845433622DAF97C06A10D0F1',
     },

     -2: {        ; KEM public key
       1: 2,      ; kty: EC2
       -1: 1,     ; crv: P256
       -2: h'5C099BEC31FAA581D14E208250D3FFDA

     },

     -3: -9       ; Derived key algorithm: ESP256
   }

   The following is the same example encoded as CBOR:

     0810c49d4ed72d582228'

5.2.  COSE key reference type: ARKG derived private key

   A reference to a private key derived using ARKG may be represented as
   a COSE_Key_Ref structure [I-D.lundberg-cose-2p-algs] whose kty is TBD
   (Ref-ARKG-derived, placeholder -65538).  This key reference type
   defines key type parameters -1 and -2 respectively for the kh and ctx
   parameters of ARKG-Derive-Private-Key. The kid (2) parameter
   identifies the ARKG private seed sk.  Thus the COSE_Key_Ref structure
   conveys all arguments to use in ARKG-Derive-Private-Key to derive the
   referenced private key.

   Table 3 defines key type parameters for the Ref-ARKG-derived key
   type.  A COSE_Key_Ref structure whose kty is TBD (Ref-ARKG-derived,
   placeholder -65538) MUST include the parameters kh (-1) and ctx (-2).
   The inst (-3) parameter MAY be used to indicate the ARKG instance
   whose ARKG-Derive-Private-Key procedure to use to derive the private
   key; its value is taken from the IANA "COSE Algorithms" registry

9.  Design rationale

9.1.  Using a MAC

   The ARKG construction by Wilson [Wilson] omits the MAC and instead
   encodes application context in the PRF labels, arguing that this
   leads to invalid keys/signatures in cases that would have a bad MAC.
   We choose to keep the MAC from the construction by Frymann et al.
   [Frymann2020], but allow it to be omitted in case the chosen KEM
   already guarantees ciphertext integrity.

   The reason for this is to ensure that the delegating party can
   distinguish key handles that belong to its ARKG seed.  For example,
   this is important for applications using the W3C Web Authentication
   API [WebAuthn], which do not know beforehand which authenticators are
   connected and available.  Instead, authentication requests may
   include references to several eligible authenticators, and the one to
   use is chosen opportunistically by the WebAuthn client depending on
   which are available at the time.  Consider using ARKG in such a
   scenario to sign some data with a derived private key: a user may
   have several authenticators and thus several ARKG seeds, so the
   signing request might include several well-formed ARKG key handles,
   but only one of them belongs to the ARKG seed of the authenticator
   that is currently connected.  Without an integrity check, choosing
   the wrong key handle might cause the ARKG-Derive-Private-Key
   procedure to silently derive the wrong key instead of returning an
   explicit error, which would in turn lead to an invalid signature or
   similar final output.  This would make it difficult or impossible to
   diagnose the root cause of the issue and present actionable user
   feedback.  For this reason, we require the KEM to guarantee
   ciphertext integrity so that ARKG-Derive-Private-Key can fail early
   if the key handle belongs to a different ARKG seed.

   It is straightforward to see that adding the MAC to the construction
   by Wilson does not weaken the security properties defined by Frymann
   et al.  [Frymann2020]: the construction by Frymann et al. can be
   reduced to the ARKG construction in this document by instantiating BL
   as described in Section 3.1 and KEM as described in Section 3.3.  The
   use of hash_to_field in Section 3.1 corresponds to the KDF_1
   parameter in [Frymann2020], and the use of HMAC and HKDF in
   Section 3.2 corresponds to the MAC and KDF_2 parameters in
   [Frymann2020].  Hence if one can break PK-unlinkability or SK-
   security of the ARKG construction in this document, one can also
   break the same property of the construction by Frymann et al.

Appendix A.  Acknowledgements

   ARKG was first proposed under this name by Frymann et al.
   [Frymann2020], who analyzed a proposed extension to W3C Web
   Authentication by Lundberg and Nilsson [WebAuthn-Recovery], which was
   in turn inspired by a similar construction by Wuille [BIP32] used to
   create privacy-preserving Bitcoin addresses.  Frymann et al.
   [Frymann2020] generalized the constructions by Lundberg, Nilsson and
   Wuille from elliptic curves to any discrete logarithm (DL) problem,
   and also proved the security of arbitrary asymmetric protocols
   composed with ARKG.  Further generalizations to include quantum-
   resistant instantiations were developed independently by Clermont
   [Clermont], Frymann et al.  [Frymann2023] and Wilson [Wilson].

   This document adopts the construction proposed by Wilson [Wilson],
   modified by the inclusion of a MAC in the key handles as done in the
   original construction by Frymann et al.  [Frymann2020].

   The authors would like to thank all of these authors for their

   *  Extracted parameter function BL-PRF and modified signatures of BL-
      Blind-Public-Key and BL-Blind-Private-Key accordingly.  This is an
      editorial refactorization; overall operation of concrete ARKG
      instances is unchanged.

   *  Removed three redundant sets of ARKG-P256 test vectors.

   *  Added intermediate values to ARKG-P256 test vectors.

   *  Changed second set of ARKG-P256 test vectors to use a 32-byte ikm
      instead of h'00'.

   *  Clarified in sections "Using HMAC to adapt a KEM without
      ciphertext integrity", "Using ECDH as the KEM" and "Using X25519
      or X448 as the KEM" that ctx_sub is intentionally ignored in those
      instances.

   -07

   *  Fixed hash_to_field DST in Sub-Kem-Derive-Key-Pair in section
      "Using ECDH as the KEM" to agree with test vectors.

   -06

   *  Changed DST construction in section "Using ECDH as the KEM" to
      include the "ARKG-ECDH." prefix everywhere in the formula.
      Previously the prefix was added in the argument to the "Using HMAC
      to adapt a KEM without ciphertext integrity" formula but not in
      the Sub-Kem functions defined in "Using ECDH as the KEM".

   -05

   *  Deleted concrete instances ARKG-curve25519ADD-X25519, ARKG-
      curve448ADD-X448, ARKG-edwards25519ADD-X25519 and ARKG-
      edwards448ADD-X448 since implementations with a non-prime order
      generator, including EdDSA, are incompatible with the additive
      blinding scheme defined in section "Using elliptic curve addition
      for key blinding".

   *  Remodeled procedures to be fully deterministic:

      -  BL-Generate-Keypair() replaced with BL-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm).

      -  KEM-Generate-Keypair() replaced with KEM-Derive-Key-Pair(ikm).

      -  ARKG-Generate-Seed() replaced with ARKG-Derive-Seed(ikm_bl,
         ikm_kem).

      -  Parameter ikm added to ARKG-Derive-Public-Key.

      -  Instance parameter hash-to-crv-suite added to generic formula
         "Using ECDH as the KEM", affecting concrete instances ARKG-
         P256ADD-ECDH, ARKG-P384ADD-ECDH, ARKG-P521ADD-ECDH and ARKG-
         P256kADD-ECDH.

      -  Section "Deterministic key generation" deleted.

   *  Flipped order of (pk_bl, pk_kem) and (sk_bl, sk_kem) parameter and
      return value tuples for consistent ordering between BL and KEM
      throughout document.

   *  info parameter renamed to ctx.

   *  ctx length limited to at most 64 bytes.

   *  Encoding of ctx in ARKG-Derive-Public-Key and ARKG-Derive-Private-
      Key now embeds the length of ctx.

   *  Renamed concrete instances and corresponding DST_ext values:

      -  ARKG-P256ADD-ECDH to ARKG-P256

      -  ARKG-P384ADD-ECDH to ARKG-P384

      -  ARKG-P521ADD-ECDH to ARKG-P521

      -  ARKG-P256kADD-ECDH to ARKG-P256k

   *  Added ARKG-P256 test vectors.

   -04

   *  Extracted COSE_Key_Ref definition and COSE algorithm registrations
      to draft-lundberg-cose-two-party-signing-algs.

   *  Redefined alg (3) parameter and added dkalg (-3) in ARKG-pub
      COSE_Key.

   *  Defined alg (3) and inst (-3) parameters of Ref-ARKG-derived COSE
      key type.

   -03

   *  Renamed section "Using HMAC to adapt a KEM without {integrity
      protection => ciphertext integrity}".

   *  Fixed info argument to HMAC in section "Using HMAC to adapt a KEM
      without ciphertext integrity".

   *  Added reference to Shoup for definition of key encapsulation
      mechanism.

   *  Added CDDL definition of COSE_Key_Ref.

   *  Editorial fixes to references.

   *  Renamed proposed COSE Key Types.

   -02

   *  Rewritten introduction.

   *  Renamed ARKG-Derive-Secret-Key to ARKG-Derive-Private-Key.

   *  Overhauled EC instantiations to use hash_to_field and account for
      non-prime order curve key generation.

   *  Eliminated top-level MAC and KDF instance parameters.

   *  Added info parameter to instance parameter functions.

   *  Added requirement of KEM ciphertext integrity and generic formula
      for augmenting any KEM using HMAC.

   *  Added curve/edwards25519/448 instances.

   *  Added proposal for COSE bindings and key reference types.

   -01

   *  Editorial Fixes to formatting and references.
