I think we can just note that implementations are free to make that choice, without defining an interoperability API for this.\r\n\r\n(A formal definition of `ARKG-Generate-Seed` is needed just to tie `BL-Generate-Keypair` and `KEM-Generate-Keypair` together, but its implementation details are not important for interoperability, unlike `ARKG-Derive-Public-Key` and `ARKG-Derive-Secret-Key`.)",

In use cases where this uncorrelatability is not needed - e.g., the WebAuthn signing extension, where the WebAuthn RP is the ARKG subordinate party and the key handle is transmitted directly between subordinate (RP) and delegating party (authenticator), this MAC is not necessary. Thus we can omit the MAC and simply use a static, opaque identifier for the ARKG seed instead.\r\n\r\nOne argument against this is the proliferation of mostly duplicated ARKG instances (e.g., `ARKG-P256ADD-ECDH` and `ARKG-P256ADD-ECDH-HMAC` are close to identical), and the fact that computing/verifying a HMAC is a tiny additional computational cost compared to the dominant operations (EC point multiplication, or even heavier PQC). I would be okay with dismissing this idea and keeping the MAC (KEM ciphertext integrity) requirement for all ARKG instances, as that addresses the widest set of use cases. I'll still rewrite some of the reasoning and some of the \"considerations\" sections in that case, though.",

Similarly, `alg` (3) of Ref-ARKG-derived references is now defined to represent the algorithm to use the derived private key with (and conversely the verification algorithm to use to verify signatures by that key, if it is a signature key) while the new parameter `inst` (-3) represents the ARKG instance to use to derive the private key.",
