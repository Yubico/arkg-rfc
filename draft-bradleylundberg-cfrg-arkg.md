--- abstract

Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (ARKG) is an abstract algorithm
that enables delegation of asymmetric public key generation without giving access to the corresponding private keys.
This capability enables a variety of applications:
a user agent can generate pseudonymous public keys to prevent tracking;
a message sender can generate ephemeral recipient public keys to enhance forward secrecy;
two paired authentication devices can each have their own private keys while each can register public keys on behalf of the other.

This document provides three main contributions:
a specification of the generic ARKG algorithm using abstract primitives;
a set of formulae for instantiating the abstract primitives using concrete primitives;
and an initial set of fully specified concrete ARKG instances.
We expect that additional instances will be defined in the future.

# Introduction

Asymmetric cryptography, also called public key cryptography, is a fundamental component of much of modern information security.
However, even the flexibility of asymmetric cryptosystems is not always enough for all applications.
For the sake of privacy and forward secrecy it may be necessary to frequently generate new keys,
but it is not always feasible for the holder of the private keys to be available whenever a new key pair is needed.
For example, this is often the case when using a hardware security device to hold private keys,
where the device may be detached or locked at the time a new key pair is needed.

The Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (ARKG) algorithm
enables the holder of private keys to delegate generation of public keys without giving access to the corresponding private keys.
This enables a public key consumer to autonomously generate public keys whenever one is needed,
while the private key holder can later derive the corresponding private key using a "key handle" generated along with the public key.

The algorithm consists of three procedures:
(1) the _delegating party_ generates a _seed pair_ and emits the _public seed_ to a _subordinate party_,
(2) the subordinate party uses the public seed to generate a public key and a _key handle_ on behalf of the delegating party, and
(3) the delegating party uses the key handle and the _private seed_
to derive the private key corresponding to the public key generated by procedure (2).
Procedure (1) is performed once, and procedures (2) and (3) may be repeated any number of times with the same seed pair.
The required cryptographic primitives are a public key blinding scheme, a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM),
a key derivation function (KDF) and a message authentication code (MAC) scheme.
Both conventional primitives and quantum-resistant alternatives exist that meet these requirements. [Wilson]

Some motivating use cases of ARKG include:

- Efficient single-use signing keys.
  The European Union has proposed a digital identity system which, in order to protect users' privacy,
  needs a unique key pair for each authentication signature.
  In online usage the system could relatively easily create a key on demand,
  submit it to a certification authority to have a single-use certificate issued for that key,
  and then submit that certificate with an authentication signature to a third party to access a service.

  However, the proposed system also includes offline use cases:
  A user might for example need to use the system in a location with poor or no internet connectivity
  to present a digital driver's license or authorize a payment.
  For this, the system may need to pre-emptively generate a large amount of single-use certificates to be used offline.

  One candidate implementation under evaluation to provide signing and key management for this system
  is the W3C Web Authentication API [WebAuthn] (WebAuthn),
  which requires a user gesture whenever a WebAuthn operation is invoked.
  A WebAuthn-based implementation of the proposed digital identity system
  could use ARKG to pre-emptively generate key pairs for offline use without the need to prompt for a user gesture for each key pair generated.

- Enhanced forward secrecy for encrypted messaging.
  For example, [section 8.5.4 of RFC 9052][rfc9052-direct-key-agreement] defines COSE representations for encrypted messages and notes that
  "Since COSE is designed for a store-and-forward environment rather than an online environment,
  \[...\] forward secrecy (see [RFC4949]) is not achievable. A static key will always be used for the receiver of the COSE object."
  Applications could work around this limitation by exchanging a large number of keys in advance,
  but that number limits how many messages can be sent before another such exchange is needed.
  This also requires the sender to allocate storage space for the keys,
  which may be challenging to support in constrained hardware.

  ARKG could enable the sender to generate ephemeral recipient public keys on demand.
  This may enhance forward secrecy if the sender keeps the ARKG public seed secret,
  since each recipient key pair is used to encrypt only one message.

- Generating additional public keys as backup keys.
  For example, the W3C Web Authentication API [WebAuthn] (WebAuthn) generates a new key pair for each account on each web site.
  This makes it difficult for users to set up a backup authenticator,
  because each time a key pair is created for the primary authenticator,
  another key pair also needs to be created for the backup authenticator, which may be stored in a safe but inconvenient location.

  ARKG could enable the primary authenticator to also generate a public key for a paired backup authenticator
  whenever it generates a key pair for itself,
  allowing the user to set up the pairing once
  and then leave the backup authenticator in safe storage until the primary authenticator is lost.

## Requirements Language

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}


## Notation

The following notation is used throughout this document:

- The symbol `||` represents octet string concatenation.

- When literal text strings are to be interpreted as octet strings,
  they are encoded using UTF-8.

- Elliptic curve operations are written in additive notation:
  `+` denotes point addition, i.e., the curve group operation;
  `*` denotes point multiplication, i.e., repeated point addition;
  and `+` also denotes scalar addition modulo the curve order.
  `*` has higher precedence than `+`, i.e., `a + b * C` is equivalent to `a + (b * C)`.

- `Random(min_inc, max_exc)` represents a cryptographically secure random integer
  greater than or equal to `min_inc` and strictly less than `max_exc`.


# The Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (ARKG) algorithm

The ARKG algorithm consists of three functions, each performed by one of two participants:
the _delegating party_ or the _subordinate party_.
The delegating party generates an ARKG _seed pair_ and emits the _public seed_ to the subordinate party
while keeping the _private seed_ secret.
The subordinate party can then use the public seed to generate derived public keys and _key handles_,
and the delegating party can use the private seed and a key handle to derive the corresponding private key.

The following subsections define the abstract instance parameters used to construct the three ARKG functions,
followed by the definitions of the three ARKG functions.


## Instance parameters

ARKG is composed of a suite of other algorithms.
The parameters of an ARKG instance are:

- `BL`: An asymmetric key blinding scheme [Wilson], consisting of:
  - Function `BL-Generate-Keypair() -> (pk, sk)`: Generate a blinding key pair.

    No input.

    Output consists of a blinding public key `pk` and a blinding secret key `sk`.

  - Function `BL-Blind-Public-Key(pk, tau) -> pk_tau`: Deterministically compute a blinded public key.

    Input consists of a blinding public key `pk` and a blinding factor `tau`.

    Output consists of the blinded public key `pk_tau`.

  - Function `BL-Blind-Secret-Key(sk, tau) -> sk_tau`: Deterministically compute a blinded secret key.

    Input consists of a blinding secret key `sk` and a blinding factor `tau`.

    Output consists of the blinded secret key `sk_tau`.

  - Integer `L_bl`: The length of the blinding factor `tau` in octets.

  `pk` and `pk_tau` are opaque octet strings of arbitrary length.
  `tau` is an opaque octet string of length `L_bl`.
  The representations of `sk`, `sk_tau` and `L_bl` are an undefined implementation detail.

  See [Wilson] for definitions of security properties required of the key blinding scheme `BL`.

- `KEM`: A key encapsulation mechanism, consisting of the functions:
  - `KEM-Generate-Keypair() -> (pk, sk)`: Generate a key encapsulation key pair.

    No input.

    Output consists of public key `pk` and secret key `sk`.

  - `KEM-Encaps(pk) -> (k, c)`: Generate a key encapsulation.

    Input consists of an encapsulation public key `pk`.

    Output consists of a shared secret `k` and an encapsulation ciphertext `c`.

  - `KEM-Decaps(sk, c) -> k`: Decapsulate a shared secret.

    Input consists of encapsulation secret key `sk` and encapsulation ciphertext `c`.

    Output consists of the shared secret `k` on success, or an error otherwise.

  `pk`, `k` and `c` are opaque octet strings.
  The representation of `sk` is an undefined implementation detail.

  See [Wilson] for definitions of security properties required of the key encapsulation mechanism `KEM`.

- `MAC`: A message authentication code (MAC) scheme, consisting of:
  - Function `MAC-Tag(k, m) -> t`: Generate a message authentication tag for a given message using a given key.

    Input consists of the shared MAC key `k` and the message `m`.

    Output consists of the MAC tag `t`.

  - Function `MAC-Verify(k, m, t) -> { 0, 1 }`: Verify a message authentication tag.

    Input consists of the shared MAC key `k`, the message `m` and the MAC tag `t`.

    Output is 1 if and only if `MAC-Tag(k, m) = t`.

  - Integer `L_mac`: The length of the MAC key `k` in octets.

  `k` is an opaque octet string of length `L_mac`.
  `m` and `t` are opaque octet strings of arbitrary length.
  The representation of `L_mac` is an undefined implementation detail.

  See [Frymann2020] for definitions of security properties required of the message authentication code scheme `MAC`.

- `KDF`: A variable-length key derivation function with the signature:
  `KDF(info, ikm, L) -> okm`

  Input consists of a domain separation parameter `info`, input key material `ikm` and output length `L`.

  Output consists of output key material `okm` of length `L` in octets.

  `info` and `ikm` are opaque octet strings of arbitrary length.
  `okm` is an opaque octet string of length `L`.
  `L` is an integer with undefined representation.

  See [Frymann2020] for definitions of security properties required of the key derivation function `KDF`.

A concrete ARKG instantiation MUST specify the instantiation
of each of the above functions and values.

The output keys of the `BL` scheme are also the output keys of the ARKG instance as a whole.
For example, if `BL-Blind-Public-Key` and `BL-Blind-Secret-Key` output ECDSA keys,
then the ARKG instance will also output ECDSA keys.

Instantiations MUST satisfy the following compatibility criteria:

- The output shared secret `k` of `KEM-Encaps` and `KEM-Decaps`
  is a valid input key material `ikm` of `KDF`.

- Output key material `okm` of length `L_bl` of `KDF`
  is a valid input blinding factor `tau` of `BL-Blind-Public-Key` and `BL-Blind-Secret-Key`.

  It is permissible for some `KDF` outputs to not be valid blinding factors,
  as long as this happens with negligible probability -
  see {{design-rationale-mac}}.

- Output key material `okm` of length `L_mac` of `KDF`
  is a valid input MAC key `k` of `MAC-Tag(k, m)` and `MAC-Verify(k, m, t)`.

  It is permissible for some `KDF` outputs to not be valid MAC keys,
  as long as this happens with negligible probability -
  see {{design-rationale-mac}}.

We denote a concrete ARKG instance by the pattern `ARKG-BL-KEM-MAC-KDF`,
substituting the chosen instantiation for the `BL`, `KEM`, `MAC` and `KDF` parts.
Note that this pattern cannot in general be unambiguously parsed;
implementations MUST NOT attempt to construct an ARKG instance by parsing such a pattern string.
Concrete ARKG instances MUST always be identified by lookup in a registry of fully specified ARKG instances.
This is to prevent usage of algorithm combinations that may be incompatible or insecure.


## The function ARKG-Generate-Seed

This function is performed by the delegating party.
The delegating party generates the ARKG seed pair `(pk, sk)`
and keeps the private seed `sk` secret, while the public seed `pk` is provided to the subordinate party.
The subordinate party will then be able to generate public keys on behalf of the delegating party.

~~~pseudocode
ARKG-Generate-Seed() -> (pk, sk)
    ARKG instance parameters:
        BL        A key blinding scheme.
        KEM       A key encapsulation mechanism.

    Inputs: None

    Output:
        (pk, sk)  An ARKG seed pair with public seed pk
                    and private seed sk.

    The output (pk, sk) is calculated as follows:

    (pk_kem, sk_kem) = KEM-Generate-Keypair()
    (pk_bl, sk_bl) = BL-Generate-Keypair()
    pk = (pk_kem, pk_bl)
    sk = (sk_kem, sk_bl)
~~~

### Deterministic key generation

Although the above definition expresses the key generation as opaque,
likely sampling uniformly random key distributions,
implementations MAY choose to implement the functions `BL-Generate-Keypair()`,
`KEM-Generate-Keypair()` and `ARKG-Generate-Seed()`
as deterministic functions of some out-of-band input.
This can be thought of as defining a single-use ARKG instance where these function outputs are static.
This use case is beyond the scope of this document
since the implementation of `ARKG-Generate-Seed` is internal to the delegating party,
even if applications choose to distribute the delegating party across multiple processing entities.

For example, one entity may randomly sample `pk_bl`, derive `pk_kem` deterministically from `pk_bl`
and submit only `pk_bl` to a separate service that uses the same procedure to also derive the same `pk_kem`.
This document considers both of these entities as parts of the same logical delegating party.


## The function ARKG-Derive-Public-Key

This function is performed by the subordinate party, which holds the ARKG public seed `pk = (pk_kem, pk_bl)`.
The resulting public key `pk'` can be provided to external parties to use in asymmetric cryptography protocols,
and the resulting key handle `kh` can be used by the delegating party to derive the private key corresponding to `pk'`.

This function may be invoked any number of times with the same public seed,
in order to generate any number of public keys.

~~~pseudocode
ARKG-Derive-Public-Key((pk_kem, pk_bl), info) -> (pk', kh)
    ARKG instance parameters:
        BL        A key blinding scheme.
        KEM       A key encapsulation mechanism.
        MAC       A MAC scheme.
        KDF       A key derivation function.
        L_bl      The length in octets of the blinding factor tau
                    of the key blinding scheme BL.
        L_mac     The length in octets of the MAC key
                    of the MAC scheme MAC.

    Inputs:
        pk_kem    A key encapsulation public key.
        pk_bl     A key blinding public key.
        info      An octet string containing optional context
                    and application specific information
                    (can be a zero-length string).

    Output:
        pk'       A blinded public key.
        kh        A key handle for deriving the blinded
                    secret key sk' corresponding to pk'.

    The output (pk', kh) is calculated as follows:

    (k, c) = KEM-Encaps(pk_kem)
    tau = KDF("arkg-blind" || 0x00 || info, k, L_bl)
    mk  = KDF("arkg-mac"   || 0x00 || info, k, L_mac)
    tag = MAC-Tag(mk, c || info)

    pk' = BL-Blind-Public-Key(pk_bl, tau)
    kh = (c, tag)
~~~

If this procedure aborts due to an error,
for example because `KDF` returns an invalid `tau` or `mk`,
the procedure can safely be retried with the same arguments.


## The function ARKG-Derive-Secret-Key

This function is performed by the delegating party, which holds the ARKG private seed `(sk_kem, sk_bl)`.
The resulting secret key `sk'` can be used in asymmetric cryptography protocols
to prove possession of `sk'` to an external party that has the corresponding public key.

This function may be invoked any number of times with the same private seed,
in order to derive the same or different secret keys any number of times.

~~~pseudocode
ARKG-Derive-Secret-Key((sk_kem, sk_bl), kh, info) -> sk'
    ARKG instance parameters:
        BL        A key blinding scheme.
        KEM       A key encapsulation mechanism.
        MAC       A MAC scheme.
        KDF       A key derivation function.
        L_bl      The length in octets of the blinding factor tau
                    of the key blinding scheme BL.
        L_mac     The length in octets of the MAC key
                    of the MAC scheme MAC.

    Inputs:
        sk_kem    A key encapsulation secret key.
        sk_bl     A key blinding secret key.
        kh        A key handle output from ARKG-Derive-Public-Key.
        info      An octet string containing optional context
                    and application specific information
                    (can be a zero-length string).

    Output:
        sk'       A blinded secret key.

    The output sk' is calculated as follows:

    (c, tag) = kh
    k = KEM-Decaps(sk_kem, c)
    mk = KDF("arkg-mac" || 0x00 || info, k, L_mac)

    If MAC-Verify(mk, c || info, tag) = 0:
        Abort with an error.

    tau = KDF("arkg-blind" || 0x00 || info, k, L_bl)
    sk' = BL-Blind-Secret-Key(sk_bl, tau)
~~~

Errors in this procedure are typically unrecoverable.
For example, `KDF` might return an invalid `tau` or `mk`, or the `tag` may be invalid.
ARKG instantiations SHOULD be chosen in a way that such errors are impossible
if `kh` was generated by an honest and correct implementation of `ARKG-Derive-Public-Key`.
Incorrect or malicious implementations of `ARKG-Derive-Public-Key` do not degrade the security
of a correct and honest implementation of `ARKG-Derive-Secret-Key`.
See also {{design-rationale-mac}}.


# Generic ARKG instantiations

This section defines generic formulae for instantiating the individual ARKG parameters,
which can be used to define concrete ARKG instantiations.


## Using elliptic curve arithmetic for key blinding {#blinding-ec}

Instantiations of ARKG whose output keys are elliptic curve keys
can use elliptic curve arithmetic as the key blinding scheme `BL` [Frymann2020]&nbsp;[Wilson].
This section defines a general formula for such instantiations of `BL`.

Let `crv` be an elliptic curve.
Then the `BL` parameter of ARKG may be instantiated as follows:

- Elliptic curve points are encoded to and from octet strings
  using the procedures defined in sections 2.3.3 and 2.3.4 of [SEC1].

- Elliptic curve scalar values are encoded to and from octet strings
  using the procedures defined in sections 2.3.7 and 2.3.8 of [SEC1].

- `G` is the generator of `crv`.
- `N` is the order of `G`.

~~~pseudocode
BL-Generate-Keypair() -> (pk, sk)

    sk = Random(1, N)
    pk = sk * G


BL-Blind-Public-Key(pk, tau) -> pk_tau

    If tau = 0 or tau >= N, abort with an error.
    pk_tau = pk + tau * G


BL-Blind-Secret-Key(sk, tau) -> sk_tau

    If tau = 0 or tau >= N, abort with an error.
    sk_tau_tmp = sk + tau
    If sk_tau_tmp = 0, abort with an error.
    sk_tau = sk_tau_tmp
~~~


## Using ECDH as the KEM {#kem-ecdh}

Instantiations of ARKG can use ECDH [RFC6090] as the key encapsulation mechanism `KEM` [Frymann2020]&nbsp;[Wilson].
This section defines a general formula for such instantiations of `KEM`.

Let `crv` be an elliptic curve used for ECDH.
Then the `KEM` parameter of ARKG may be instantiated as follows:

- Elliptic curve points are encoded to and from octet strings
  using the procedures defined in sections 2.3.3 and 2.3.4 of [SEC1].

- Elliptic curve coordinate field elements are encoded to and from octet strings
  using the procedures defined in sections 2.3.5 and 2.3.6 of [SEC1].

- Elliptic curve scalar values are encoded to and from octet strings
  using the procedures defined in sections 2.3.7 and 2.3.8 of [SEC1].

- `ECDH(pk, sk)` represents the compact output of ECDH [RFC6090]
  using public key (curve point) `pk` and secret key (exponent) `sk`.

- `G` is the generator of `crv`.
- `N` is the order of `G`.

~~~pseudocode
KEM-Generate-Keypair() -> (pk, sk)

    sk = Random(1, N)
    pk = sk * G


KEM-Encaps(pk) -> (k, c)
    (pk', sk') = KEM-Generate-Keypair()

    k = ECDH(pk, sk')
    c = pk'


KEM-Decaps(sk, c) -> k

    pk' = c
    k = ECDH(pk', sk)
~~~


## Using the same key for both key blinding and KEM {#blinding-kem-same-key}

When an ARKG instance uses the same type of key for both the key blinding and the KEM -
for example, if elliptic curve arithmetic is used for key blinding as described in {{blinding-ec}}
and ECDH is used as the KEM as described in {{kem-ecdh}} [Frymann2020] -
then the two keys MAY be the same key.
Representations of such an ARKG seed MAY allow for omitting the second copy of the constituent key,
but such representations MUST clearly identify that the single constituent key is to be used
both as the key blinding key and the KEM key.


## Using HMAC as the MAC {#mac-hmac}

Let `Hash` be a cryptographic hash function.
Then the `MAC` parameter of ARKG may be instantiated using HMAC [RFC2104] as follows:

~~~pseudocode
MAC-Tag(k, m) -> t

    t = HMAC-Hash(K=k, text=m)


MAC-Verify(k, m, t) -> { 0, 1 }

    t' = HMAC-Hash(K=k, text=m)
    If t = t':
        return 1
    Else:
        return 0
~~~


## Using HKDF as the KDF {#kdf-hkdf}

Let `Hash` be a cryptographic hash function.
Then the `KDF` parameter of ARKG may be instantiated using HKDF [RFC5869] as follows:

~~~pseudocode
KDF(info, ikm, L) -> okm

    prk = HKDF-Extract with the arguments:
        Hash: Hash
        salt: not set
        IKM: ikm

    okm = HKDF-Expand with the arguments:
        Hash: Hash
        PRK: prk
        info: info
        L: L
~~~


# Concrete ARKG instantiations

This section defines an initial set of concrete ARKG instantiations.

TODO: IANA registry? COSE/JOSE?


## ARKG-P256-ECDH-P256-HMAC-SHA256-HKDF-SHA256

The identifier `ARKG-P256-ECDH-P256-HMAC-SHA256-HKDF-SHA256` represents the following ARKG instance:

# COSE bindings

TODO?: Define COSE representations for interoperability:
- ARKG public seed (for interoperability between different implementers of `ARKG-Generate-Seed` and `ARKG-Derive-Public-Key`)
- ARKG key handle (for interoperability between different implementers of `ARKG-Derive-Public-Key` and `ARKG-Derive-Secret-Key`)

# Design rationale

## Using a MAC {#design-rationale-mac}

The ARKG construction by Wilson [Wilson] omits the MAC and instead encodes application context in the PRF labels,
arguing this leads to invalid keys/signatures in cases that would have a bad MAC.
We choose to keep the MAC from the construction by Frymann et al. [Frymann2020] for two purposes.

The first is so that the delegating party can distinguish between key handles addressed to it
and those addressed to other delegating parties.
We anticipate use cases where a private key usage request may contain key handles for several delegating parties
eligible to fulfill the request,
and the delegate party to be used can be chosen opportunistically depending on which are available at the time.
Without the MAC, choosing the wrong key handle would cause the `ARKG-Derive-Secret-Key` procedure to silently derive the wrong key
instead of returning an explicit error, which would in turn lead to an invalid signature or similar final output.
This would make it difficult or impossible to diagnose the root cause of the issue and present actionable user feedback.
The MAC also allows ARKG key handles to be transmitted via heterogeneous data channels,
possibly including a mix of ARKG key handles and similar values used for other algorithms.

The second purpose is so that the delegating party can be assured that no errors should happen
during the execution of `ARKG-Derive-Secret-Key`, such as out-of-range or invalid key values.
For example, key generation in `ARKG-Derive-Public-Key` might be done by randomly testing candidates [NIST.SP.800-56Ar3]
and retrying `ARKG-Derive-Public-Key` until a valid candidate is found.
A MAC enables `ARKG-Derive-Secret-Key` to assume that the first candidate from a given pseudo-random seed will be successful,
and otherwise return an explicit error rejecting the key handle as invalid.
`ARKG-Derive-Public-Key` is likely to run on powerful general-purpose hardware, such as a laptop, smartphone or server,
while `ARKG-Derive-Secret-Key` might run on more constrained hardware such as a cryptographic smart card,
which benefits greatly from such optimizations.

It is straightforward to see that adding the MAC to the construction by Wilson
does not weaken the security properties defined by Frymann et al. [Frymann2020]:
the construction by Frymann et al. can be reduced to the ARKG construction in this document
by instantiating `KEM` as group exponentiation
and instantiating `BL` as group multiplication to blind public keys and modular integer addition to blind secret keys.
The `MAC` and `KDF` parameters correspond trivially to the MAC and KDF parameters in [Frymann2020],
where KDF<sub>1</sub>(_k_) = KDF(_k_, _l_<sub>1</sub>) and KDF<sub>2</sub>(_k_) = KDF(_k_, _l_<sub>2</sub>)
with fixed labels _l_<sub>1</sub> and _l_<sub>2</sub>.
Hence if one can break PK-unlinkability or SK-security of the ARKG construction in this document,
one can also break the same property of the construction by Frymann et al.

# Acknowledgements

ARKG was first proposed under this name by Frymann et al. [Frymann2020],
who analyzed a proposed extension to W3C Web Authentication by Lundberg and Nilsson [WebAuthn-Recovery],
which was in turn inspired by a similar construction by Wuille [BIP32] used to create privacy-preserving Bitcoin addresses.
Frymann et al. [Frymann2020] generalized the constructions by Lundberg, Nilsson and Wuille
from elliptic curves to any discrete logarithm (DL) problem,
and also proved the security of arbitrary asymmetric protocols composed with ARKG.
Further generalizations to include quantum-resistant instantiations
were developed independently by Clermont [Clermont], Frymann et al. [Frymann2023] and Wilson [Wilson].

This document adopts the construction proposed by Wilson [Wilson],
modified by the inclusion of a MAC in the key handles as done in the original construction by Frymann et al. [Frymann2020].

The authors would like to thank all of these authors for their research and development work that led to the creation of this document.
